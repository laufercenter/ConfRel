\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {8}{\ignorespaces The per residue free energy calculation found some differences of the sidechain orientation in computer generated model 1 and experimental structure of CASP target T0538. (A) Two salt bridges between residues E35-R32 and E28-K24 exist in the native structure. These are absent in the computer generated model structure. Instead (B) a new salt bridge is formed between residues R32-E28 in model. (C) Another salt bridge between residues R26-E50 in the experimental structure. (D) In comparison to the native structure, orientation of F51 differs in the model.}}{28}
