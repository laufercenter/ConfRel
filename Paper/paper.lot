\contentsline {table}{\numberline {1}{\ignorespaces The confinement method assigns a more favorable free energy to the experimentally determined structure than to computer-generated predictions. For each target, we examined as many as five predictions submitted by CASP participants. We report the free energy difference between the most favorable decoy and the experimentally determined structure. Positive $\Delta \Delta G (=G_{best\nobreakspace {}decoy} - G_{native})$ values indicate that the experimental structure is predicted to be more favorable than any of the decoys.}}{30}
