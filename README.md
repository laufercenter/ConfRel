ConfRel
=======

Confine and release method as metapredictor


Git
====
use git clone git@github.com:laufercenter/ConfRel.git to initialize the repo

use git pull to retrieve data from github

when you make changes to files you tell git this by:
git add file
git commit 'Did x change'

Where the add tells which files to keep track of
and the commit tells it to keep a record of what changed. (commit as often as possible)

Finally git push will upload things to the server
